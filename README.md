**Assignment-1**

**M1: MLOps Foundations**

**Objective**: Understand the basics of MLOps and implement a simple CI/CD pipeline.

**Tasks**:

1.	**Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline**:

•	Use a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to set up a pipeline for a sample machine learning project.

•	Include stages for linting, testing, and deploying a simple machine learning model.

2.	**Version Control**:

•	Implement version control for your project using Git.

•	Demonstrate branching, merging, and pull requests.

**Deliverables**:

•	A report detailing the CI/CD pipeline stages.

•	Screenshots or logs showing successful runs of the pipeline.

•	A Git repository link with branches and merge history.

**M2: Process and Tooling**

**Objective**: Gain hands-on experience with popular MLOps tools and understand the processes they support.

**Tasks**:

1.	**Experiment Tracking**:

•	Use MLflow to track experiments for a machine learning project.

•	Record metrics, parameters, and results of at least three different model training runs.

2.	**Data Versioning**:

•	Use DVC (Data Version Control) to version control a dataset used in your project.

•	Show how to revert to a previous version of the dataset.

**Deliverables**:

•	MLflow experiment logs with different runs and their results.

•	A DVC repository showing different versions of the dataset.

**M3: Model Experimentation and Packaging**

**Objective**: Train a machine learning model, perform hyperparameter tuning, and package the model for deployment.

**Tasks**:

1.	**Hyperparameter Tuning**:

•	Use a library like Optuna or Scikit-learn’s GridSearchCV to perform hyperparameter tuning on a chosen model.

•	Document the tuning process and the best parameters found.

2.	**Model Packaging**:

•	Package the best-performing model using tools like Docker and Flask.

•	Create a Dockerfile and a simple Flask application to serve the model.

**Deliverables**:

•	A report on hyperparameter tuning results.

•	A Dockerfile and Flask application code.

•	Screenshots of the model running in a Docker container.

**M4: Model Deployment & Orchestration (Optional)**

**Objective**: Deploy a machine learning model and orchestrate its operations using Kubernetes.

**Tasks**:

1.	**Model Deployment**:

•	Deploy the Dockerized model from M3 to a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

•	Use a platform service like AWS ECS, Azure AKS, or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

2.	**Orchestration**:

•	Set up a Kubernetes cluster.

•	Deploy the model using Kubernetes and create a Helm chart for managing deployments.

**Deliverables**:

•	A link to the deployed model endpoint.

•	Kubernetes configuration files and Helm chart.

•	A report detailing the deployment and orchestration process.

**M5: Final Deliverables**

•	A zip file containing:

•	Code

•	Data

•	Model

•	A one-page summary that includes:

•	Description of the work completed

•	Justification for the choices made

•	A screen recording (maximum 5 minutes) that:

- Explains the work done
- Shows the results
